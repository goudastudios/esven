                            <p>I am grateful for having had the chance to live, work and be inspired in such vibrant centers of creativity as Sydney, London, New York, Tokyo, San Francisco and Moscow (yes, that Moscow). I have crafted insights and helped create award-winning work for some of the most iconic and successful brands on the planet - AAA, Charles Schwab, The Gap - and for challenger brands such as Salesforce, fin-tech innovator iShares, and renewables leader, SunPower. I have led teams of between 4 and 40 all around the world, I have run immersion and longitudinal research for Netflix in Japan, instigated and implemented complete rebrands, undertaken a 20,000 item brand audit, and was selected by Andreessen Horowitz as a branding resource for a16z’s portfolio of start-ups and established-growth companies. Throughout a career on both the agency and client side, I bring to the table experience in multiple categories - from software to solar, banks to beverages, non-profit to new-tech, and from computers to counties and countries. I sharpened my entrepreneurial skills while co-founding and running Ozone, a design, strategy and advertising firm in North Beach, for 13 years.  I help founders tell their brand story in ways that are compelling and enduring.</p>

                            <p>I am a seasoned and skilled creative director and designer with over 20 years of experience. I have helped tell stories visually for companies at all levels of development - from startups to multinationals. I seek to solve complex problems with elegant design solutions that provide invaluable insight, assets, and results. Beyond a comprehensive knowledge of art and design, I also strive to hone a keen sense of trends, and how to stay ahead of them. At a time when too many solutions seem to require cramming in too many elements, leading to confusion, I have found it very valuable to instead create a Zen-like clean, simple, and clear visual representation of ideas. It is my goal to always play at the vision level while continuing to find innovative pathways to communicate the story of place and identity for each brand.</p>
