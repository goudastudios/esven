      "My mission is to empower innovative founders and align with ventures that demonstrate clear market potential.

    bio: "I invest in people. Some of those people are in early stage opportunities, because higher risk equals higher reward. Some are later stage, where a payout is simply more likely. Some have been in the business a lot longer than I have, and have started or joined funds - once I am sure I can trust them, I know enough to let them do what they do. All of those people have something I have found to be vital to success - call it drive, commitment, the ability to attract talent and other funding, and/or an understanding that without a compounding advantage, the chances of success are slim. I know people, and when I find ones that have these attributes, I invest. Advertising and Technology are in my background, with over 25 years of experience in Global Brand Management, Emerging Media, Disruptive Ad Tech and Mobile-Video-Social Platforms with network effects. I have a proven track record of growing new, pioneering products to scalable and profitable businesses by assembling best-in-class teams, setting clear and transparent operational and GTM strategies, and building successful partnerships. I know I don’t know it all. I know what it’s like to be on a team with a great idea that simply failed. But I also know what it takes to have 2 stellar IPO’s and 2 fruitful M&A’S >$1B in stakeholder returns. I like what I do. I invest in people.",

I have helped tell stories visually for companies at all levels of development - from startups to multinationals. I seek to solve complex problems with elegant design solutions that provide invaluable insight, assets, and results. Beyond a comprehensive knowledge of art and design, I also strive to hone a keen sense of trends, and how to stay ahead of them. At a time when too many solutions seem to require cramming in too many elements, leading to confusion, I have found it very valuable to instead create a Zen-like clean, simple, and clear visual representation of ideas. It is my goal to always play at the vision level while continuing to find innovative pathways to communicate the story of place and identity for each brand.",
