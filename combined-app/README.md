# Combined Esven App

This folder contains the new combined HTML app for Esven, built from selected elements of the three design concepts as outlined in `docs/Combined_Design.md`.

## Structure
- `index.html` — Main landing page
- `portfolio.html` — Portfolio showcase
- `team.html` — Team page
- `contact.html` — Contact page
- `assets/` — Images, icons, and other media
- `css/` — CSS files for global and page-specific styles
- `components/` — HTML partials for shared sections (header, footer, etc.)

## Instructions
- Edit HTML files as needed, following the roadmap in `Combined_Design.md`.
- Shared sections should be kept as partials in `components/` for maintainability.
- All static assets (images, fonts, etc.) go in `assets/`.
- Deploy by pushing to GitHub; Vercel will serve the static files from this directory.
