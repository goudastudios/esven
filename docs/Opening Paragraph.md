We know people

We invest in people

We can spot the people who will succeed, 

who live, eat, and breath their ideas,

and will stop at nothing to achieve them

who understand the need for a compounding advantage 

have a compelling vision that is disruptive; 

who can and will attract talent and capital.

Our Strategy: 

Our strategy is one of concentration with diversification.

There is no ‘One Right Way’.

We utilize multiple strategies.

We know we don’t know it all.

But we know people who do.

Knowing the right people leads to a lot more clarity, simplicity and productivity.



How we operate:

We find the right people with disruptive ideas. 

Help them find and fill their gaps.

Connect them to the people we know who will take them further.

Much further.



Who we’ve helped:

Obviously what we invest in doesn’t tell you as much as who we invest in.

 

**<u>This Portion added to the Porfolio Page</u>**
